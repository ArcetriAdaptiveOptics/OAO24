Image Processing\n","## 1.1 Introduction\n","\n","The primary goal of adaptive optics (AO) is to correct for atmospheric turbulence in real time, allowing astronomers to obtain images that approach the diffraction limit of the telescope. While AO can greatly improve image sharpness, several **post-processing** steps are still required to optimise the scientific return. \n","\n","Typically in observing campaigns, before doing science on the collected image, the series of raw data are reduced using *auxiliary* images. These are calibration images that are needed to calibrate cientific image (with photometry o spectroscopy) to correct for instrumental effects.\n","\n","These *auxiliary* images are mainly of 3 types:\n","\n","- **Bias images**: these are taken with zero exposure time and a closed shutter (no incoming photons). They measure the electronic offset introduced by the CCD readout process.\n","\n","- **Flat field images**: these are obtained by imaging a uniformly illuminated source and allow us to measure the spatial variation in the response of the optical system and detector.\n","\n","- **Dark images**: these are acquired with the same exposure time of the science image but with the shutter closed and used to remove dark current from the detector, which is a contributor to the thermal noise signal that needs to be considered, especially when our target is a faint object. Typically, these frames are neglected in the image reduction routine, as detectors are cooled to cryogenic temperatures.\n","\n","So as shown in the following scheme, the processing of the collected raw images $S_{raw}$ can be expressed by the following relation:\n","\n","$$\n"," S_{red} = \\frac{S_{raw} - B}{F - B} \n","$$ \n","\n","where $S_{red}$ is the science image after the reduction of the bias, $B$, and the normalization to the flat field, $F$."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<div>\n","<img src=\"correction of science image.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n","However, in the context of our current dataset, we will focus specifically on **background subtraction** from the collected images, without the use of *auxiliary* calibration images.

If the peak of the PSF becomes saturated, the FWHM will be underestimated.\n","\n","- **Background inspection and estimation**: in the previous example, we assumed that the background was constant across the field. However, in real observations the background level can vary spatially due to factors such as uneven sky brightness, and it's important to account for this variation when performing background subtraction.\n","\n","- **Detector artefact**: detectors often contain hot or cold pixels (pixels that exhibit spurius high or low signal levels), which may result in larger readout noise. These artefacts pollutes measurements and should be identified and corrected during image processing.\n","\n","- **Shift & Add**: in image processing, it is used to improve image quality, particularly when combining multiple images into a data cube, by compensating for slight movements in the centroid of the PSF between successive images, which can occur due to atmospheric turbulence (i.e. Tip/Tilt) or telescope's tracking drifts.\n","\n","\n","\n","**NB**: \n","\n","In this tutorial, our primary focus is on reducing background noise in images to evaluate the performance of AO-assisted observations. As mentioned in the introduction, performing scientific analysis on the final master image requires careful calibration using auxiliary images, such as bias, flat, and dark frames. \n","\n","Furthermore, it's important to note that, for scientific analysis, additional steps are required beyond background subtraction. For instance, if we were performig photometriy, we would need to convert the analog-to-digital units (ADU) of the science camera into physical flux units to quantify the brightness of objects. Similarly, if the goal is to perform astrometry, we would need to into account for the pixel scale and correct any distortions in the image to accurately measure objects' position and study their kinematics.\n","\n","For a comprehensive discussion of these topics, see [(J.
