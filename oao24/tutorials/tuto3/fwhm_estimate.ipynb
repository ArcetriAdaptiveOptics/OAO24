    "As usual, we keep it too easy :-) ! \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to keep in mind the following aspects, when we discuss about open and closed-loop PSFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selecting the PSF Model**: as the closed-loop data seems to have a high AO correction, the actual PSF looks more like an **Airy disk** diffraction pattern ruther than a Gaussian or a Moffat. Thus, fitting these models, as we did so far, may underestimate or poorly fit the closed loop PSF, especially in the wings, and lead to significant residuals. On the other side, as we mention before, in open-loop condition a Moffat model better fits the broader PSF shape due atmospheric turbulence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Telescope pupil**: so far we considered circular pupil apertures for our fitting models. However, telescope pupils are far from beeing perfectly circular due to the presence of spider that supports the mirror in the optical train, which obscure and block portions of the pupil.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PSF ellipcity**: in the fitting models considered in this section, the PSF model is assumed to be radially symmetric. However, the PSF ellipcity can provide valuable insights into several aspects of the optical system and atmosphere. Particularly, the  the elongation and asymmetry of the PSF is related to:\n",
    "    - **anisoplanatism**, as the angular distance between the guide star and the science target increases;\n",
    "    - **residual astigmatism**, due imperfect ao correction of the turbulence or NCPA;\n",
    "    - **wind direction**, that causes elongation or smearing of the PSF due to differential refraction in the atmosphere along the wind direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Task and Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "It's your turn again :-) ! Can you improve the FWHM estimation and minimize the residual by selecting different fitting models and weighting the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Repeat the fit with Airy diffraction pattern with the **astropy** model `AiryDisk2D` (see [2D Models](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/modeling/predef_models2D.html) for more ditails).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Advanced: can you improve the fit using a better T152 pupil model? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat the same analysis for the Visible image (Hint: use `VisibleExampleData.get_close_loop_data_cube()` defined in `image_processing.py`and rember to update wavelengths the other parameters for the ORCA Flash 4.0 V2 camera manufactured by Hamamatsu -  6.5um/px, 800nm TBC)\n",
    "\n",
